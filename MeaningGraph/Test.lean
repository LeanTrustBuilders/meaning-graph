# Tests for `MeaningGraph`

Unit checks for the standalone dependency analysis: the name classification that decides where the
analysis stops, the `Expr`-level constant collection the dependency lists are built from, the
recovery of dependencies the elaborated term drops (notation, coercions), and the graph passes that
run on the resulting `(name, deps)` graph.

Each check is a `#guard`, so any regression turns into a build error. Run with `lake build MeaningGraphTest`.

The dependency lists, which need a full `Environment`, are checked on Lean core
(`MeaningGraph.TestOptions`) and on declarations written for the purpose (`MeaningGraph.TestHash`).

/-! ## Name classification -/

-- `isPrefixWithDigitSuffix pfx s`: `pfx` then a non-empty run of digits.
#guard isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "match_" "match_1"
#guard isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "match_" "match_12"
#guard !isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "match_" "match_"          -- empty suffix
#guard !isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "match_" "match_x"         -- non-digit suffix
#guard !isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "match_" "match_1a"        -- mixed suffix
#guard !isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "match_" "prefix_1"        -- wrong prefix
#guard isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "eq_" "eq_2"
#guard isPrefixWithDigitSuffix "hcongr_" "hcongr_11"

-- `isAuxComponent`: a single name component that the compiler auto-generates.
#guard isAuxComponent "_hyg"           -- underscore-led
#guard isAuxComponent "_proof_3"
#guard isAuxComponent "match_1"
#guard isAuxComponent "eq_4"

#guard isInternalName `Foo.match_1
#guard isInternalName `Foo._proof_2
#guard isInternalName `Foo.bar._hyg        -- internal in a non-leaf position
-- The recursor family, `casesOn`, and constructor companions like `injEq` are deliberately
-- *not* caught here: `shouldExpose` excludes them via environment metadata instead
-- (`isAuxRecursor`, `hasConstructorPrefix`, `ConstantInfo.recInfo`), since string-matching alone
-- can't distinguish them from a user declaration that happens to share the name.
#guard !isInternalName `List.rec
#guard !isInternalName `Foo.casesOn
#guard !isInternalName `Foo.injEq
-- `mk` is *not* flagged syntactically: the real constructor is excluded via the environment
-- (`ctorInfo`) in `shouldExpose`, while a user `def Foo.mk` must remain exposed.
#guard !isInternalName `Foo.mk
#guard !isInternalName `Nat.add
#guard !isInternalName `Foo.bar
#guard !isInternalName `Foo.barRec        -- `rec` only matches as a whole component

-- `hasPrefixName n p`: `p` is `n` itself or one of its dotted ancestors (component-wise,
-- NOT a string prefix).
#guard hasPrefixName `LML `LML
#guard hasPrefixName `LML.Foo.Bar `LML
#guard hasPrefixName `LML.Foo.Bar `LML.Foo
#guard !hasPrefixName `LMLExtra.Foo `LML   -- must not match on a string prefix

/-! ## `Expr`-level constant collection

Up to Lean 4.33, `Expr.getUsedConstants` recursed *through* an `Expr.proj` node without ever
reporting the structure name it carries, so a structure an elaborated term reaches only by
projecting a field would have been missing from its dependencies;
`projStructureNames` recovered exactly those names and `exprUsedConstants` appended them to what
core reports. Core closed the gap in 4.34, so `exprUsedConstants` is now `getUsedConstants`
unchanged, and `projStructureNames` remains the proven statement of the recovery that would be
needed again were core to regress — the first guard below is what would fail.

Both are pure functions of an `Expr`, so — unlike `usedConstantsOf`, which needs an
`Environment` — they can be checked here directly. -/

private def natE : Expr := .const `Nat []
private def zeroE : Expr := .const `Nat.zero []
private def projA : Expr := .proj `A 0 (.bvar 0)

-- The 4.34 fix `exprUsedConstants` now relies on: core itself reports the structure name of a
-- projection of a bound variable. If this fails, core dropped the name again and
-- `exprUsedConstants` must go back to appending `projStructureNames`.
#guard Expr.getUsedConstants projA == #[`A]
#guard projStructureNames projA == #[`A]
#guard exprUsedConstants projA == #[`A]

-- Projections are found under every structural node the walk descends into.
#guard projStructureNames (.app projA (.proj `B 1 (.bvar 1))) == #[`A, `B]
#guard projStructureNames (.lam `x natE projA .default) == #[`A]
#guard projStructureNames (.forallE `x natE projA .default) == #[`A]
#guard projStructureNames (.letE `x natE projA (.proj `B 0 (.bvar 0)) false) == #[`A, `B]
#guard projStructureNames (.mdata {} projA) == #[`A]

-- Structurally identical subterms are walked once, so a shared projection is reported once...
#guard projStructureNames (.app projA projA) == #[`A]
-- ...while two *different* projections of the same structure both report it (consumers dedup).
#guard projStructureNames (.app projA (.proj `A 1 (.bvar 0))) == #[`A, `A]

-- With no projection anywhere, `projStructureNames` finds nothing to recover.
#guard projStructureNames (.app natE zeroE) == (#[] : Array Name)

-- Ordinary constants and projected structures are both reported.
#guard exprUsedConstants (.app zeroE projA) == #[`Nat.zero, `A]

/-! ## Dependencies the elaborated term does not mention -/

-- `coercionSourceType?`: the type coerced *from* in a coercion-class application, seen through binders.
#guard coercionSourceType? (mkApp2 (mkConst ``CoeFun) (mkConst ``Nat) (mkConst ``Nat)) == some `Nat
#guard coercionSourceType?
  (.forallE `x (mkConst ``Nat) (mkApp2 (mkConst ``CoeOut) (mkConst ``Int) (mkConst ``Int)) .default)
  == some `Int
#guard coercionSourceType? (mkConst ``Nat) == none   -- not a coercion-class application

-- `evalNameExpr?`: reconstruct the `Name` an `Expr` builds via `Name.anonymous`/`mkStr*`/`str`.
#guard evalNameExpr? (mkConst ``Lean.Name.anonymous) == some Name.anonymous
#guard evalNameExpr? (mkApp2 (mkConst ``Lean.Name.mkStr2) (mkStrLit "Foo") (mkStrLit "bar"))
  == some `Foo.bar
#guard evalNameExpr? (mkConst ``Nat.add) == none   -- not a name-building application
-- `collectEmbeddedNames` finds such names anywhere in the expression tree.
#guard (collectEmbeddedNames
  (mkApp (mkConst ``id) (mkApp2 (mkConst ``Lean.Name.mkStr2) (mkStrLit "A") (mkStrLit "b")))).contains

/-! ## Graph passes

These run on the plain `(name, deps)` graph, with the caller having already chosen which edges
count.

#guard topologicalClosure diamond #[`Z] == #[`Z]

-- The defining property: for the full ordering, every node precedes all nodes that depend on it.
-- Here `lib → util → core`, with an extra `app → lib`, so the order must be core, util, lib, app.

#guard transitiveDeps diamond `A == #[`E, `D, `B, `C]
#guard transitiveDeps diamond `E == (#[] : Array Name)
#guard transitiveDeps diamond `Z == (#[] : Array Name)   -- unknown node ⇒ no dependencies
-- Self-reference (mutual recursion) is filtered out, but the cycle partner is kept.
#guard transitiveDeps cyclic `A == #[`B]

/-! ### `reverseDeps` (who uses whom, restricted to nodes of the graph) -/

private def revGraph : Array (Name × Array Name) := #[
